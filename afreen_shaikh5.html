                <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>
                <p>Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.), known as Abraham in the Bible, was born in the ancient city of Ur in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). He belonged to a family that practiced idol worship. His father, Azar (or Terah), was a well-known idol-maker. Despite growing up in such an environment, Ibrahim (A.S.) was blessed with wisdom from an early age. He questioned the beliefs of his people and sought the truth about the Creator of the universe.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Search for the Truth</h2>
                <p>Ibrahim (A.S.) observed nature and realized that the sun, moon, and stars could not be gods because they set and disappeared. Through deep reflection, he concluded that there is only One God (Allah) who is eternal and controls everything. This strong belief made him a pioneer of monotheism.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>"When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord!' But when it set, he said, 'I do not love things that set.'" (Quran 6:76)</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Confronting Idol Worship</h2>
                <p>One of the great things about Ibrahim (A.S.) was his courage to stand against falsehood. He openly challenged his father and his people about idol worship. When they refused to listen, he demonstrated the powerlessness of idols by breaking them, leaving only the largest idol, to show that idols could not defend themselves. For this, he was thrown into a massive fire by King Namrud (Nimrod), but Allah saved him, making the fire cool and safe.</p>

                <p>Due to the opposition he faced, Ibrahim (A.S.) migrated from his homeland with his followers to spread the message of Allah. He traveled through different lands, including Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, always calling people towards Tawheed (Oneness of Allah).</p>
