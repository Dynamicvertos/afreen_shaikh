                <div class="image-caption">Artistic representation of Prophet Nuh (A.S.) and his Ark</div>
            </div>

            <p>Prophet Nuh (A.S.), known as Noah in English, is one of the greatest prophets in Islam and is mentioned multiple times in the Qur'an. He is regarded as one of the five Ulul Azm Prophets (prophets of strong determination), along with Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.), Prophet Musa (A.S.), Prophet Isa (A.S.), and Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.). His story teaches us patience, perseverance, and steadfastness in the face of extreme opposition.</p>

            <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>
            <p>Prophet Nuh (A.S.) was born approximately 1,000 years after Prophet Adam (A.S.). Scholars suggest that he was born in an era when people had strayed far from the path of Allah. Initially, humanity was united in monotheism, worshipping only Allah. However, as generations passed, people began to worship idols due to Shaytan's (Satan's) deception.</p>
            <p>In Nuh's time, idol worship had become widespread. People created idols named Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasr (mentioned in Surah Nuh 71:23) and believed these idols could bring them blessings. The society was corrupt, full of arrogance, pride, and injustice. It was during this dark period that Allah chose Nuh (A.S.) as His prophet to guide people back to Tawheed (belief in one God).</p>

            <h2>Prophethood of Nuh (A.S.)</h2>
            <p>Allah appointed Nuh (A.S.) as a messenger to his people when they were deeply immersed in polytheism. His mission was to call his people to worship only Allah and abandon idol worship. This mission was extremely challenging because people were very stubborn.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>Indeed, We sent Nuh to his people, [saying], 'Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment.'" (Surah Nuh 71:1)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>950 Years of Dawah (Preaching)</h3>
            <p>Prophet Nuh (A.S.) preached to his people for 950 years, calling them to the path of Allah day and night. He tried every possible method:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Openly and privately: He preached in public gatherings and spoke to individuals in private.</li>
                <li>Day and night: His efforts were continuous without a break.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite his tireless efforts, only a small group of poor and humble people accepted his message. The majority, especially the wealthy and arrogant leaders, rejected him. They mocked him, saying he was just an ordinary man and not a prophet. They even accused him of lying.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>He said, 'My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day, but my invitation increased them not except in flight.'" (Surah Nuh 71:5-6)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Supplication to Allah</h3>
            <p>After centuries of rejection, Prophet Nuh (A.S.) realized that his people would not believe. Allah revealed to him:</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                <p>None of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing." (Surah Hud 11:36)</p>
            </div>

            <p>At this point, Nuh (A.S.) prayed:</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                <p>My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant." (Surah Nuh 71:26)</p>
            </div>

            <p>Allah accepted his prayer and commanded him to build an ark (ship).</p>

            <h3>Construction of the Ark</h3>
            <p>Allah instructed Nuh (A.S.) to build a massive ark that could withstand a great flood. He was told to make it from planks of wood and nails. While he was building the ark, people mocked him:</p>
            <p>"Have you become a carpenter now?"</p>
            <p>"Where is the water for your ship?"</p>
            <p>They laughed because there was no sea nearby. Nuh (A.S.) replied that they would soon know the truth.</p>

            <h3>The Great Flood</h3>
            <p>When the time came, Allah commanded Nuh (A.S.) to take with him the believers and pairs of every species of animals, birds, and creatures. The signs of punishment began: water gushed forth from the earth and rain poured from the sky in torrents.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>So We opened the gates of the heaven with water pouring down, and We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met for a matter already predestined." (Surah Al-Qamar 54:11-12)</p>
            </div>

            <p>The flood covered everything. Those who disbelieved were drowned, including Nuh's own son, who refused to board the ark and thought he could escape by climbing a mountain.</p>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>He said, 'I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.' [Noah] said, 'There is no protector today from the decree of Allah except for whom He gives mercy.' And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned." (Surah Hud 11:43)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Death of Prophet Nuh (A.S.)</h2>
            <p>Prophet Nuh (A.S.) lived a very long life. According to Islamic tradition, he lived for around 950 years preaching, and even longer overall. Before his death, he advised his children:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Worship Allah alone and avoid shirk (associating partners with Allah).</li>
                <li>Be humble and obedient to Allah.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He died a peaceful death, and his soul returned to Allah after fulfilling his great mission. His grave is believed to be in Najaf (Iraq) or some say in Turkey, but the exact location is unknown.</p>

            <h2>Lessons from His Life</h2>
            <div class="lesson-list">
                <p>The importance of patience and perseverance in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p>The significance of faith and trust in Allah's plan.</p>
                <p>The value of warning others about the consequences of disbelief.</p>
                <p>The reminder that guidance is ultimately in Allah's hands.</p>
            </div>
