                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is regarded as the last and final messenger of Allah in Islam. He was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the "Year of the Elephant." His father, Abdullah, passed away before his birth, and his mother, Aminah, died when he was just six years old. Orphaned at a young age, Muhammad was placed under the care of his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, and later his uncle, Abu Talib.</p>
                <p>From childhood, Muhammad was known for his honesty, integrity, and noble character. People in Mecca called him "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) because of his truthfulness and reliability. He worked as a shepherd in his early years and later as a merchant. At the age of 25, he married Khadijah, a wealthy and honorable woman, after successfully managing a trade caravan for her. Their marriage was blessed with children and mutual respect.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Revelation and Prophethood</h2>
                <p>At the age of 40, while meditating in the cave of Hira, Muhammad received his first revelation through the angel Jibreel (Gabriel). The first words revealed were "Iqra" (Read), marking the beginning of the Quran's revelation. Over the next 23 years, the Quran was revealed to him, guiding humanity toward monotheism, justice, and moral values.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    The first word revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was "Iqra" which means "Read" - emphasizing the importance of knowledge in Islam.
                </div>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad preached the message of Islam: belief in one God (Allah), doing good deeds, helping the poor, and avoiding evil. His message faced strong opposition from the leaders of Mecca, who feared losing power and influence. Despite persecution, he remained patient and steadfast. His followers faced hardships, and many were tortured, but they stood firm in their faith.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Migration to Medina and Islamic Society</h2>
                <p>In 622 CE, due to increasing hostility in Mecca, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina, an event known as the Hijrah, marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, he established the first Islamic state based on justice, equality, and brotherhood. He signed treaties for peace and promoted coexistence between different religious communities.</p>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad continued to spread the message of Islam through wisdom, good character, and peaceful means, though he also defended the Muslim community against attacks. He united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam, abolishing tribal discrimination and promoting equality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Character and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad was known for his compassion, humility, and forgiveness. He cared for the poor, orphans, and the needy. Even towards his enemies, he showed mercy and forgiveness. His famous Farewell Sermon emphasized equality, justice, and rights for all.</p>
                <p>He passed away in 632 CE in Medina at the age of 63, leaving behind a legacy of faith, guidance, and moral conduct. Today, over 1.9 billion Muslims around the world follow his teachings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Birth and Early Years</h2>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the "Year of the Elephant." He belonged to the respected Quraysh tribe, specifically the Hashim clan. His father, Abdullah, died before his birth, and his mother, Amina, cared for him in his early years. He was named Muhammad, meaning "the praised one."</p>
                <p>His birth was considered blessed, as many signs were reported, indicating his future greatness as a messenger of Allah. Orphaned at a young age, he was under the care of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib and later his uncle Abu Talib.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Status in Paradise</h2>
                <p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) holds the highest rank in Jannah, known as Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud (the Praised Station). He is the leader of all prophets and the first to enter Paradise. In Jannah, he will intercede for his Ummah on the Day of Judgment, ensuring many believers are granted mercy.</p>
                <p>His palace will be the most magnificent, near the Throne of Allah, surrounded by rivers of milk, honey, and pure water. He will reside in the highest part of Paradise, Al-Firdaus Al-A'la, with the righteous. Believers long to meet him there, where eternal peace and happiness prevail under Allah's mercy.</p>
